# Functions in C++ and Python

A **function** is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help organize code, make it reusable, and avoid repetition. While both C++ and Python support functions, their definitions and syntax differ slightly.

## Functions in C++

In C++, a function consists of three main parts:
1. **Return type**: Specifies the type of value the function will return (e.g., `int`, `void`).
2. **Function name**: The name used to call the function.
3. **Parameters (optional)**: Inputs that the function accepts to perform its task.

A function in C++ can either return a value or just perform an action without returning anything if the return type is `void`.

## Functions in Python

In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by:
- **Function name**.
- **Parameters (optional)** in parentheses.
- **Return value** (optional), if the function needs to send a result back.

Unlike C++, Python does not require you to declare the return type, as Python is dynamically typed.

## Common Purpose
In both languages, functions:
- Improve **code readability**.
- Reduce **redundancy**.
- Break down tasks into **manageable parts**.
- **Reuse** code, making programs easier to maintain.

Functions make programs more modular and efficient by organizing logic into reusable pieces.
